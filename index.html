          <h2>Why the passion?</h2>
          <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>My passion begins with ultimate frisbee, yes that's correct, not actually roundnet. I was introduced to the sport of ultimate my freshman year of college. It changed my life. Not only is ultimate a competitive field sport but it is also the most fun I've ever had with the best people I have ever met. The community is amazing, welcoming and supportive. I grew up playing all kinds of sports but never had I felt this connected.
            </br>
            </br>
            I discovered roundnet, or as most refer to it as the popular brand name 'Spikeball', while playing ultimate. In between ultimate games my teammates began playing roundnet as a way to have fun and stay loose. As natural competitors we discovered that what appears to be a simple yard game actually has a ton of strategy and beautiful dynamic game play.
            </br>
            </br>
            Ultimate consumed my life for over ten years and my love for the sport still exists today. But eventually due to injuries and exhaustion I started to loose my desire to play as intensely. The beginning to the end of my competitive ultimate career was a bit scary. It's all I had known for so long. Will I loose my community? The less I wanted to play ultimate, the more I wanted to play roundnet. And luckily roundnet has a similar community and overlaps quite a bit with the ultimate community still.
            </br>
            </br>
            When my two friends, my husband and I moved to a house in Denver we began to meet all kinds of people from all backgrounds. One main thing we had in common was a love of sports and the outdoors. But of course, we all loved different sports, some frisbee, some soccer, some volleyball. Our house decided to introduce roundnet to everyone. It was a new sport everyone could learn together and it utilizes skills from so many sport backgrounds.
            </br>
            </br>
            The past three years the same group of people meet multiple nights a week to socialize, enjoy the Denver weather, laugh and play roundnet. And our group is constantly growing as we welcome others to join. We all look forward to our roundnet sessions. Playing roundnet with my friends clears my mind and exercises my body and soul. Whether roundnet is actually your passion or not, I hope you have found or find whatever it is that brings you the joy roundnet brings me.
